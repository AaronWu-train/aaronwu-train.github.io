    summary: |
      我開發了一套結合元啟發式最佳化演算法（包含基因演算法與登山演算法）與專用模擬器的自動化旅客列車時刻排班系統，能在考量乘客需求的同時，快速產出無衝突、運輸成功率高且旅途時間最短的最佳時刻表。

      I developed an automated passenger train timetable scheduling system that integrates metaheuristic optimization algorithms—including genetic algorithms and hill-climbing—with a custom simulator to rapidly generate conflict-free schedules that maximize transport success rates and minimize travel time while meeting passenger demand.
